        A front-end developer and designer focused on accessible, impactful websites.

        I blend UX, motion, and code to help nonprofits, artists, and mission-driven
        brands get engagement online.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the last 15+ years I've designed and built websites, interfaces, and
        interactive experiences — from content-heavy nonprofit sites to immersive,
        LED-driven installations.
      </p>

      <p>
        My sweet spot is front-end development and UX: turning ideas into clear,
        intuitive, accessible experiences that still feel alive and expressive.
